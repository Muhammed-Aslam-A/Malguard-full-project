MalGuard is a machine learning–based malware detection system that classifies files or applications as malicious or benign using a trained model. The project demonstrates how AI techniques can be applied in cybersecurity for early malware detection.

This project is developed as a mini-project to showcase the use of machine learning in malware analysis.
